    <h2>HACSA - Tech4Girls</h2>
    <p>A women-led, global, non-profit, non-partisan, non-governmental, 
        civil society organisation and charity with its headquarters in 
        Ghana, the Heritage and Cultural Society of Africa (HACSA) Foundation 
        is registered as a 501(c)(3) organisation in the Caribbean and the United States. 
        Through collaboration, advocacy, education, and innovation, we promote social impact 
        and transformation within the framework of the Sustainable Development Goals of the 
        United Nations. <br>
        <p>Tech4Girls is a practical learning initiative that helps women and girls grow 
        their careers by teaching them digital skills including coding, AI, and ICT. 
        With the help of this program, African women and girls will have the chance 
        to learn about technology and develop the skills necessary for careers in 
        STEM fields. Soft skills like leadership, emotional intelligence, and entrepreneurship 
        are also taught to them.
